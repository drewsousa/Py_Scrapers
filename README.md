## Some very simple Python3 scripts to scrape information from the internet

---
<kbd>#></kbd> Scrape_Open_IP_Ports.py  
I'd generally just use NMAP but this is quick and simple and easy to pull into other projects.

<kbd>#></kbd> Scrape_PDF_2_CSV.py  
Darn simple but also the beauty of Python. Scrape PDF data into a CSV in just 4-5 lines of code

<kbd>#></kbd> Scrape_TLS_Cert_SANs.py  
I have not finished this yet. When doing security footprints of an Org sometimes you'll find very interesting information in the Cert SANs (Subject Alternative Name) that can help find new hosts or help enumerate domains or sub-domains.

<kbd>#></kbd> Scrape_Weather.py  
Your standard "Learning Python" weather scraper. I added MacOS keychain intergration.
